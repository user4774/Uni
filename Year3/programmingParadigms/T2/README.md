# Task 2 (Prolog): Is it cold, flu or COVID-19? (Expert System)


> "In artificial intelligence, an expert system is a computer system emulating the decision-making ability of a human expert.
> Expert systems are designed to solve complex problems by reasoning through bodies of knowledge, represented mainly as ifâ€“then rules rather than through conventional procedural code.
> The first expert systems were created in the 1970s and then proliferated in the 1980s. Expert systems were among the first truly successful forms of artificial intelligence (AI) software.
>
> An expert system is divided into two subsystems: the **inference engine** and the **knowledge base**. The _knowledge base_ represents facts and rules. The _inference engine_ applies the rules to the known facts to deduce new facts. Inference engines can also include explanation and debugging abilities."

Design and implement an Expert System (ES) in Prolog that can **diagnose** and **provide information** on the symptoms of cold, common flu, and COVID-19.
Additionally, your ES should be able to provide information on how to **manage** the symptoms and **prevent the spread** of the condition to others.

Start by reading the chapter in the file "*D. Crookes - An application in Medicine.pdf*".

1) Create your *knowledge base* by coding the official NHS symptoms **facts** available from:

  - <https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/common-cold/>
  - <https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/flu/>
  - <https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/main-symptoms/>

    Add other facts and **rules** from *reliable* sources, and ensure you give citations/links to the sources.

    Alongside diagnosis, the system should be able to address the following questions about a given condition "C":

    - What are the common symptoms of C?
    - What should I do if I have symptoms of C?
    - What are the risk factors for severe illness from C?
    - How can I prevent the spread of C?
    - What is the difference between C1 and C2?
